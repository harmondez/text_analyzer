# Text Analyzer in Python 📝
Welcome to my first text analysis project! 
This simple Python program allows you to explore and extract key information from any text input.


## What does this analyzer do?
📊 Counts how many times three user-chosen letters appear in the text.

🧮 Displays the number of words and characters (including spaces!).

🔠 Shows the first and last letter of the text.

🔄 Reverses the text:

  -By letters

  -By words

Detects if the word "Python" is present.


## How to use it?
Run text_analyzer.py

Enter your text when prompted.

Choose three letters to analyze.

Enjoy the statistics and insights provided by the program!

## Project goals 🎯
Practice:

Working with input() and print() functions.

Using methods like .lower(), .split(), .count(), and slicing.

Basic programming logic and control flow in Python.

## Future improvements (coming soon):
Support for analyzing any number of letters.

Word frequency analysis.

A simple graphical user interface (GUI).

Export results to .txt or .csv files.
